### P5 Cultural Immersion Programme

Our Primary 5 students attend a cultural immersion trip to develop 21st century competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills. It is also to heighten their awareness of Asia and Singapore's role in the world. By experiencing the trip, students are able to develop a deeper commitment, rootedness, pride and love for Singapore.
