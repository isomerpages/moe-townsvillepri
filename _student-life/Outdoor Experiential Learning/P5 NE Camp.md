The P5 pupils will continue their outdoor experiential learning journey, embarking on a 3 day 2 night National Education Camp. This is a progression to what they have learnt during their P4 camp experience. Key national education messages are also infused through the outdoor activities, exploring the diverse communities of people in Singapore and their way of life. At the end of the camp, we hope to develop pupils' enjoyment in doing outdoor activities and working well as a team.
