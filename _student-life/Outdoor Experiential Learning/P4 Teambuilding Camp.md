Every year the P4 pupils will embark on a 2 day 1 night Teambuilding Camp. Through this camp, we hope to nurture our pupils to be confident and independent with a sense of adventure. Through teambuilding games, rock wall-climbing and other rope activities, our pupils will have a chance to apply teamwork and leadership skills.
