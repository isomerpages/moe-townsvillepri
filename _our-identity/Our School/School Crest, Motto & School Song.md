The school crest is triangular in shape. The triangle, geometrically, the most stable of all shapes, symbolizes stability and steadfastness. The school logo, consisting of the letters T and P (Townsville Primary), is white in colour. It symbolizes the innocence and purity of young untarnished minds. It rests in the centre of the inner royal blue triangle. 

The motto “Do Our Best” is placed above the logo and signifies the school’s strong determination to develop and shape each student according to individual needs, capabilities and changing trends.

<center>
Townsville, <br>
The name that’s most dear <br>
To every staff and student here <br> 
You’ve taught us how to care and share <br> 
To do our best and never despair <br>
Wisdom and wit, we’ll require <br>
Creative thinkers, we aspire <br>
Lifelong learners we want to be <br>
Brave people of integrity <br>
  
	
Chorus: <br>
Townsville, our guide <br>
To you we pledge <br>
We’ll do our best <br>
Townsville, our pride <br>
To Singapore, loyal we’ll be <br> 
Townsville, our guide <br>
To you we pledge <br>
We’ll do our best <br>
Townsville, our pride <br>
We’ll keep our colours flying high
