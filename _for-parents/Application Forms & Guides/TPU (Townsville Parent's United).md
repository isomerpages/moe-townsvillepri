TPU comprises parent volunteers (PVs) of not only existing TVPS students but also those who have since graduated. These PV alumni return to Townsville regularly to volunteer their time, expertise and services because of their sense of belonging to the Townsville community.

Helmed by an Executive Committee, the TPU seeks to fulfil three primary objectives: (a) Engage parents actively and positively in school activities; (b) Support non-teaching activities/events in the school; and (c) Serve as a 2-way communication channel between parents and the school.

TPU coordinates PV participation in school programmes (e.g. Reading Programmes), events as well as organizes workshops and activities for parents.

Parents who would like to be involved in school programmes and activities, please contact Mrs Lam Siew Chin, Corporate Support Officer @64574345.
