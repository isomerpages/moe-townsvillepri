## MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS)

The MOE FAS seeks to help needy Singaporean families reduce their burden in meeting essential school expenses and ensures that no Singaporean child is denied an education due to financial reasons.  
  
 <u> Eligibility Criteria for MOE FAS </u>
 a.      The family’s gross household income (GHI) does not exceed $2,500 per month; or  
 b.     The family’s per capita income (PCI) does not exceed $625 per month. <br>
For families with GHI which exceeds $2,500, the PCI is computed by dividing the gross household income by the number of household members (e.g. the student, parents, unmarried siblings and grandparents of the child, as well as other dependents living in the same household).
