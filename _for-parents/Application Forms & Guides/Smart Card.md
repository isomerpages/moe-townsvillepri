The SSC serves as a stored value card for concessionary travel on buses and MRT. Students can also use the SSC for borrowing books at school library and public libraries.  Students will be issued with the SSC from primary one onwards. The card is valid until a student reaches the end of his primary education or when he leaves the school system even though it is before the expiry date of the SSC.

The SSC serves as a student identification pass. It also serves as a library card for borrowing books in the school library and branches of the National Library Board. In addition, the card can be used as a farecard for concessionary travel on buses and MRT.  Students can top up the value of the SSC at any Ticket Offices (TOs), Passenger Service Centres (PSCs), General Ticketing Machines (GTMs), Add Value Machines (AVMs) or TransitLink Card Replacement Offices (CROs) at MRT Stations and bus interchanges.

Operating hours: 8am to 6 pm daily, closed on Public Holidays. 

The lost card will be invalidated only after 48 hours from the time of reporting.
