### Leadership Development

In Townsville Primary School, we believe that “Every Child Is A Leader”. Our school vision “Leaders of Character, Learners for Life”, is espoused in the LiT Programme which is designed based on two principal provisions- the ‘Training’ and ‘Opportunities’.       
  
Through the LiT Programme, the school seeks to develop leadership skills in students progressively, on a continuum appropriate to their level of maturity, beginning with self leadership, class leadership, school leadership and culminating in community leadership.
