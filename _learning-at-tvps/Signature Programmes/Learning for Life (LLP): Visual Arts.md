The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Townsville,&nbsp;**_Visual Arts for Life,_**&nbsp;provides our students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, sense of empathy, joy of learning, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and interpersonal skills. Students are exposed to various Master, Local and Student Artists.

Besides art making process, students are further engaged through art-making discussions, writing their artist statements/reflections and self/peer art critique. Students also have opportunities to be involved in the real-life application of product design.

Selected studentsâ€™ art works are on display at our very own in-house art galleries:&nbsp;**_Our Young Passionate Artists Wall_**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**_The Arte_**. This allows students to learn more from their friend as artists, model after them, integrate ideas and inspirations drawn from their works, and be encouraged to create their own expression of visual arts.&nbsp;The LLP structure is also designed to provide support for all students with different aptitude/interest (three-tier approach).
