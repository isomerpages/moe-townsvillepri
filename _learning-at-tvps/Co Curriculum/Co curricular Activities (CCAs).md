Co-curricular Activities (CCA) are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Though not compulsory at the primary school level, CCA enable students to discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation.

Townsville Primary School offers&nbsp;CCA&nbsp;from the following options:
* Clubs and Societies
* Physical Sports
* Uniformed Groups
* Visual and Performing Arts Group

Students who are actively engaged in activities not offered as a CCA in Townsville, and would like to represent the school at their respective competitions and/or games may approach the school through their form teachers. Townsville will fully support the endeavors of all our students, providing them the chance to pursue their specific interests and ideas.
