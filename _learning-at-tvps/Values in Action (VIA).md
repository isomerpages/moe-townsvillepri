Grounded on our school value, compassion, the Values-in-Action (VIA) programme is designed with the intent to nurture our pupils to be socially responsible and to help them understand that everyone has a role in enhancing the well-being of the community and the country.

Guided by the dual themes of ‘Growing a Big Heart’ and ‘Caring for the Environment’, our pupils are given opportunities to contribute to a spectrum of VIA programmes during their formative years in Townsville.
