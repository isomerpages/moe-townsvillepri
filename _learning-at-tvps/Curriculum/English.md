### Vision     
Every Townsvillite is a:
* Confident and effective communicator in speech and writing
* Discerning reader who is self-directed and passionate about the language

### Learning Framework

**@TVPS we work towards cultivating the learning of the English Language through 3 aspects; the heart, mind and hand. This engaged learning culture is what we engineer here at Townsville.**

**Exposure. Experience. Environment.**

**STELLAR Curriculum @TVPS**
* The 2020 Syllabus was implemented from primary 1 in 2020 with greater emphasis on metacognition, multi-literacies and inquiry through dialogue. This will be achieved through explicit focus on differentiated instruction and assessment for learning
* The 3Es approach in designing lesson experiences for each STELLAR theme in our curriculum, provides the rich exposure to meaningfully engage our students in building a strong foundation in the areas of listening, speaking, reading, writing and grammar and vocabulary with an increased emphasis on the development of 21st century competencies.

### Key Programmes 

#### Enriching Language Experiences @TVPS 

**Fun with EL Week & Hot News Interactive**
* In this digital age, we want our students to take advantage of opportunities to develop in their competencies to be empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers and keep the passion for learning the English Language ignited for life. 
* What better way… than our EL week HOT News Interactive experiences! Activities include:
	* Character Dress Up day
	* Language games
	* Investigate.Interact.Innovate (create presentations on digital platforms like Padlet, Flipgrid and the SLS)
	* Research and debate on contemporary issues developing the discerning reader

_In TVPS, we ensure language teaching will connect the curriculum meaningfully and appropriately through talk, task and technology in the classroom._ 

**Speech and Drama (P1&P2)**
* Speech and drama lessons in the EL curriculum is aimed at growing the confident speaker in each Townsvillite. The programme allows students to express themselves freely and explore their imagination.
* Students work on skills like voice projection, articulation and spatial awareness. 
* They put up mini class performances for their peers and family to enjoy.

**Scrabble in Word Study** <br>
Vocabulary lessons here, expose our children to structured play in strengthening their vocabulary knowledge and application. They enjoy using Scrabble, a board game, to work collaboratively in vocabulary building with their peers and then follow up with their teachers to focus on selected words for an in-depth word study.
