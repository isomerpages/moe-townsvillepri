### Vision
Love Math, Love Learning Math

### Learning Framework
In Townsville, the learning of Math takes into cognizance our learners’ profiles, the innovations in pedagogies and affordance of technologies.

In our classrooms, we focus on providing pupils students with learning experiences that encompasses the use of the Gradual Release of Responsibility model (GRR). This is done through Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) and Polya’s UPDC thinking tool to ensure our students’ holistic development.
