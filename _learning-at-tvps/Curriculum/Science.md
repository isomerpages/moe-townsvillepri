### Vision
Every student a passionate, caring, hands-on scientific inquirer.

### Learning Framework
Adopting an inquiry-based approach to learning, students investigate problems and search for possible solutions through asking questions, making observations, hypotheses testing and critical thinking as well as develop explanations backed by evidence. Scientific knowledge as well as process skills are emphasised during classroom teaching, co-curriculum activities and stretch programmes, thus nurturing 21st century competencies of critical thinking, invention thinking and effective communication skills.

### Key Programmes
Working and thinking like scientists, students apply science knowledge and skills and are imbued with attitudes and ethics.  Their curiosity is triggered and are instilled with a sense of wonder about the world around them and to show care and concern for the environment. They experience the important processes of exploring, investigating, discovering and co-constructing new knowledge through the science total curriculum framework: **tier one curriculum, co-curriculum, stretch curriculum**  

#### 1. Tier One Curriculum – Routine Inquiry Oriented Lessons

Science as inquiry stresses active student learning and the importance of understanding scientific concepts. To build the foundation for such skills development, essential process skills (e.g. classifying, interpreting information, planning investigations) which encompass both thinking as well as practical skills are emphasised at different levels to match learners' cognitive development. During such lessons, students are given opportunities to learn by doing. They are encouraged to ask questions and find answers too.

#### 2. Co-Curriculum – Thematic Science Week

Thematic activities are carried out once a term for one week to complement tier one curriculum by exposing students to science around them and in everyday lives, demonstrating science concepts within and beyond the primary school syllabus. These fun hands-on activities seek to engage students of all levels through authentic experiences beyond the classroom at places like the library, eco-garden, open spaces around the school.

#### 3. Stretch Curriculum – E2K@Townsville

The E2K Science @ Townsville programme offers opportunities to stretch talented students in higher level scientific investigations and to discover and deepen their understanding of advanced science concepts. Framed by the school wide UPDC (Understand, Plan, Do, Check) problem solving approach, it seeks to provide opportunities for students to develop their problem-solving and thinking skills, through being critical and analytical about existing problems, generate ideas to improve the situation, develop prototypes to test and improve their ideas.
