### Vision
To better understand the interconnectedness in Singapore and the world we live in through inquiry and authentic learning experiences.

### Learning Framework
In Townsville, all pupils are given an opportunity to understand the Singapore Story through specially designed Learning Experiences and the commemoration of core NE events. Students are also given the opportunity to bond with students of other races and backgrounds and to internalize the NE messages through life-skills activities such as NE show, NE camps and overseas cultural immersion programmes. 

### Key Programmes
**Commemoration of the NE Core events:** <br>
<u> Remembering Singapore’s Historical Events </u> <br>
Each year, Townsville Primary School commemorates the following events:

(a) Total Defence Day - marking the day in 1942 when Singapore fell to the Japanese. The commemoration will serve to remind everyone that they have a part to play in the Total Defence of Singapore.

(b) International Friendship Day - aims to sensitize our students towards the geo-political realities and the importance of Singapore to maintain its international space and good relations with neighbouring countries.

(c) Racial Harmony Day - marking the day in 1964 when racial riots broke out in Singapore.  It is to remind everyone that racial understanding and tolerance must not slacken.

(d) National Day (9 Aug) - a national theme will be given to all schools each year to give focus to their celebration of Singapore's independence.
